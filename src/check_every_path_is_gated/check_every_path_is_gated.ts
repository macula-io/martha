// The mechanical check step 2 asks for: a path that reaches a shell-holding
// member with no control makes CI fail, naming the path.
//
// This runs in CI (see the `gate coverage` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml) and
// its unit tests plant ungated paths to prove it is not vacuous: a row copied
// from the table without its control, a row whose control field was forgotten, a
// row claiming the shell gate while the gate does not refuse it, a row naming a
// delivery gate that does not exist, a delivery gate that admits everyone, one
// that refuses everyone, and one that answers only some of the questions.
//
// A name is not a control, and neither is a gate that gets one question right.
// Every delivery gate a row names is DRIVEN here, once per question it has to
// answer: it must refuse an unattested message, a session talking to itself, a
// message addressed elsewhere, a kind that is not talk, and a sender the roster
// does not name — and it must admit a rostered member, so a gate that refuses
// everything is caught too.
